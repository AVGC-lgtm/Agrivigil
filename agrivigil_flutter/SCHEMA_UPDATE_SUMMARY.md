# AGRIVIGIL Schema Update Summary

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive set of updated SQL schema files for the AGRIVIGIL application based on the analysis of your entire codebase. The schema has been modernized, optimized, and organized into modular files for better maintainability.

## Created Schema Files

All schema files are located in: `agrivigil_flutter/schemas/`

### 1. **01_master_schema.sql** (Main Schema)
- Complete database structure with all tables
- Includes views, functions, and triggers
- Covers all modules: Core, Field Operations, QC, Legal, Lab, Audit

### 2. **02_indexes_and_policies.sql** (Performance & Security)
- Comprehensive indexing strategy for optimal performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Role-based access control implementation

### 3. **03_seed_data.sql** (Initial Data)
- All system roles with proper permissions
- Test users for each role (password: Test@123)
- Master data for products, QC checkpoints, test parameters
- System settings configuration

### 4. **04_migration_from_existing.sql** (Migration Script)
- Safe migration from existing database
- Transaction-based with automatic rollback on errors
- Migration logging for tracking progress
- Data quality fixes included

### 5. **05_quick_setup.sql** (Quick Installation)
- Runs all scripts in correct sequence
- For fresh installations
- Includes verification steps

### 6. **README.md** (Documentation)
- Complete documentation for the schema
- Installation instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Maintenance procedures

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Security
- Row Level Security on all tables
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for critical operations
- Secure password handling with pgcrypto

### 2. Better Performance
- Strategic indexes on all foreign keys
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Optimized views for frequent operations
- Proper data types for all columns

### 3. Data Integrity
- Check constraints on status fields
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Updated timestamp triggers
- Data validation rules

### 4. New Features
- User session management
- Notification system
- System settings configuration
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Enhanced metadata support

### 5. Improved Structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper data types (INTEGER instead of VARCHAR for counts)
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage
- Better organization of related tables

## Migration Path

### For New Installation:
```bash
cd agrivigil_flutter/schemas/
psql -U your_user -d your_database -f 05_quick_setup.sql
```

### For Existing Database:
```bash
# First, backup your database!
pg_dump -U your_user your_database > backup.sql

# Then run migration
cd agrivigil_flutter/schemas/
psql -U your_user -d your_database -f 04_migration_from_existing.sql
```

## Test Users Created

| Role | Email | Password | Officer Code |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Super Admin | super.admin@agrivigil.com | Test@123 | SA-001 |
| Field Officer | field.officer@agrivigil.com | Test@123 | FO-MUM-001 |
| Lab Analyst | lab.analyst@agrivigil.com | Test@123 | LA-MUM-001 |
| QC Inspector | qc.inspector@agrivigil.com | Test@123 | QC-MUM-001 |
| District Agriculture Officer | dao.mumbai@agrivigil.com | Test@123 | DAO-MUM-001 |

## Next Steps

1. **Review the schema files** to ensure they meet your requirements
2. **Backup your existing database** before any migration
3. **Test in a development environment** first
4. **Run the appropriate installation script**
5. **Verify the installation** using the test users
6. **Update your application configuration** if needed

## Notes

- All timestamp fields now use TIMESTAMPTZ for proper timezone handling
- Password field uses pgcrypto for secure hashing in seed data
- All tables have created_at and updated_at with automatic triggers
- RLS policies ensure users can only access appropriate data
- The schema supports all features found in your Flutter application

## Support Files Location

All files are in: `agrivigil_flutter/schemas/`
- Total files created: 6
- Total lines of SQL: ~2,500+
- Comprehensive coverage of all application modules

The schema is now ready for deployment!
