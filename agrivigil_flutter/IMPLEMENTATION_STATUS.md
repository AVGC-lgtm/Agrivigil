## üìã Next Steps

### 1. **Run the App**
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd agrivigil_flutter

# Run on your connected device/emulator
flutter run

# Or specify a device
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

### 2. **Configure Supabase**
1. Update `lib/config/supabase_config.dart` with your actual Supabase credentials:
   - Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` with your project URL
   - Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your anon key

2. Set up your Supabase database:
   - Run the SQL commands from `supabase_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This will create all necessary tables, RLS policies, and initial data

### 3. **Add Missing Assets**
If you have custom assets (logos, images, etc.), add them to:
- `assets/images/` - for images
- `assets/icons/` - for icons
- `assets/animations/` - for Lottie animations
- `assets/fonts/` - for custom fonts

### 4. **Test Features**
1. **Authentication**: Test login with different user roles
2. **QR Scanning**: Test the product scanning feature
3. **CRUD Operations**: Test data management in each module
4. **Permissions**: Verify RBAC is working correctly

### 5. **Platform-Specific Setup**

#### Android
- Minimum SDK version may need adjustment for camera features
- Add necessary permissions in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` if not already present

#### iOS
- Add camera and location permissions in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
- Configure signing in Xcode

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **File Picker Warnings**: The warnings about `file_picker` plugin structure are harmless and can be ignored
2. **Camera SDK Warning**: If you see camera SDK warnings, you may need to update the Android compileSdkVersion
