# Simplified Role System for AgriVigil

## Overview
We've simplified the role system to include only **4 essential roles** that correspond directly to our **4 main dashboards**.

## The 4 Essential Roles

### 1. Field Officer
- **Dashboard**: `/field-officer-dashboard`
- **Description**: Field inspection and execution officer
- **Code**: FO
- **Priority**: 1

### 2. Lab Analyst
- **Dashboard**: `/lab-analyst-dashboard`
- **Description**: Laboratory analysis and testing
- **Code**: LA
- **Priority**: 2

### 3. QC Inspector
- **Dashboard**: `/qc-inspector-dashboard`
- **Description**: Quality Control inspection
- **Code**: QC
- **Priority**: 3

### 4. District Agriculture Officer
- **Dashboard**: `/dao-dashboard`
- **Description**: District level agriculture officer
- **Code**: DAO
- **Priority**: 4

## What This Means

✅ **Registration**: Users can only select from these 4 roles
✅ **Dashboards**: Each role has a dedicated, specialized dashboard
✅ **Navigation**: Users are automatically redirected to their role-specific dashboard after login
✅ **Simplicity**: No confusion about which role to choose

## Database Changes

- **Removed**: Extra roles like Legal Officer, Lab Coordinator, HQ Monitoring, etc.
- **Kept**: Only the 4 essential roles with their dashboards
- **Clean**: Registration dropdown now shows only relevant options

## Files Updated

1. `lib/services/role_service.dart` - Updated `getRegistrationRoles()` method
2. `migrate_existing_agrovigil.sql` - Simplified role creation
3. `cleanup_extra_roles.sql` - Script to remove extra roles
4. `lib/screens/auth/register_screen.dart` - Added role description

## Benefits

- **Clearer UX**: Users know exactly what each role means
- **Focused Development**: We can perfect these 4 dashboards
- **Easier Maintenance**: Less complexity in role management
- **Better Testing**: Fewer edge cases to handle

## Next Steps

1. Run the migration script to update your database
2. Run the cleanup script to remove extra roles
3. Test registration with the simplified role selection
4. Verify each role redirects to the correct dashboard

This simplified approach ensures a better user experience and more focused development effort!
