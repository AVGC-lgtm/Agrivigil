# Role-Based Dashboards Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Perfect Database Schema** (`supabase_perfect_schema.sql`)
- Created comprehensive schema matching your registration fields
- Roles table with dashboard routes
- Users table with all registration fields
- Indexes for performance
- RLS policies for security
- Default roles with specific dashboard routes

### 2. **Role-Based Dashboards Created**
- **Field Officer Dashboard** - Complete with stats, quick actions, recent activities
- **Lab Analyst Dashboard** - Lab overview, test progress charts, recent results
- **QC Inspector Dashboard** - Compliance tracking, QC actions, inspection status
- **District Agriculture Officer Dashboard** - Team management, performance charts

### 3. **Smart Role-Based Routing**
- **RoleDashboardMapper** utility to map roles to dashboards
- Automatic redirection after login based on user role
- Automatic redirection after registration
- Fallback to default dashboard for unknown roles

### 4. **Updated Login/Registration Flow**
- Login screen redirects to role-specific dashboard
- Registration screen redirects after auto-login
- Both use the centralized RoleDashboardMapper

### 5. **Registration Fields Matched to Database**
- Full Name → `name`
- Email → `email`
- Phone (+91) → `phone`
- Officer Code → `officer_code`
- Role (dropdown) → `role_id` (UUID reference)
- District → `district`
- Password → `password`
- Additional data → `metadata` (JSONB)

## 🚀 To Use This System

### 1. **Set Up Your Database**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Run the entire contents of supabase_perfect_schema.sql
```

### 2. **Test Different Roles**
After registration, users will be automatically redirected to:
- Field Officer → Field Officer Dashboard
- Lab Analyst → Lab Analyst Dashboard
- QC Inspector → QC Inspector Dashboard
- District Agriculture Officer → DAO Dashboard
- Others → Default Dashboard (placeholder for now)

### 3. **Registration Process**
1. User fills registration form
2. Selects role from dropdown
3. On success → Auto-login → Redirected to role dashboard

### 4. **Login Process**
1. User enters credentials
2. On success → System checks user role
3. Redirected to appropriate dashboard
